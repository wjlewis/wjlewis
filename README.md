I took an introductory drawing course not too long ago.
One day, the instructor showed us a photo of a large installation he had just completed.
It was beautiful, and I asked him, "Miller, how long did it take you to do that?"
He turned towards me with a smile on his face and a look that indicated he'd been patiently waiting for this moment for months since the class began.
"63 years", he answered.
"But I put the first marks on it about 3 months ago, if that's what you're asking."
